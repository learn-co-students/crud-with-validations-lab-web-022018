Define a model with validations for Song.
Define all RESTful routes for songs.
Build views that connect to each other using route helpers.
Use form_for to build forms with pre-fill and error list features.
  (Hint: Try using a partial to cut down on copypasting!)
Allow deleting songs with a link, using link_to. (HINT: You might need to add some functionality so that
  you can properly delete a song using just a link. Be sure to include your new assets in application.html.erb.)
Use strong parameters in your POST/PATCH controller actions.
Set the root route to the song index.
